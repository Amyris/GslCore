Amyris domain specification language for rapidly specifying genetic designs

## Community

* Discussion of the language, development and usage is in [this google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gslx).

## Documentation
Documentation in the repo is sparse currently, but you can find

* the scientific paper describing the language [Genotype Specification Language ](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00194)

* A springer book chapter [Engineering Genomes with Genotype Specification Language](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-7795-6_21)

This library provides all core modules of the compiler, template code for constructing an application, and a set of plug-ins providing basic core functionality.  

_NB: the actual compiler front end is in [this repository](https://github.com/Amyris/Gslc) and can be built from a distributed packaged version of GslCore without building this repository._
