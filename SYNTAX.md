# Genotype Specification Language syntax

This doc is very much a work in progress.

## Gene names

Gene names can be specified as either "common" names (ie `GAL1`) or systematic names (ie `YBR020W`).
For genes whose common or systematic name contain non-alphanumeric characters, surround the gene name with backticks (\`) to escape the special characters (ie `\`IMP2'\`` or `\`YML009C-A\``).
